         <h1>About the Utah Jazz</h1>
         <p>
           The Utah Jazz are a franchise basketball team in the national basketball assoscation. They are currently in the Northwest division along with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Portland Trailblazers, Oklahoma City Thunder, and the Denver Nuggets. The Jazz are currently one of the better teams in the western conference this year, finishing with the 5th seed prior to being elimiated in the first round of the 2019 NBA playoffs, to the Houston Rockets.
         </p>
         
         <h2>Key Players</h2>
         <p>
             The Jazz are lead by to key players, Donavon Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. Donavon mitchell is the source of Utah's offense, averaging 23.8 points a game in just his second season as a pro. Rudy Gobert is a defensive powerhouse, when he is on the floor Utah's defense plays significantly better, he averaged 2.3 blocks and 12.9 rebounds a game in the 2018-2019 regular season, and is the likely favorite to get the defensive player of the year award. This would be the second consectutive year he has recieved this award.
         </p>
         
         <h2>Notable Free Agents:</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>Ricky Rubio</li>
             <li>Royce O'neale</li>
             <li>Derrick Favors</li>
        </ul>
         
         <h2>Outlook</h2>
         <p>
             It is easy to be optimistic about Utah's future, though the Jazz haven't been a big attraction for free agents, the Jazz have a solid and young core with players like Donavon Mitchell(22), Rudy Gobert(26), and Royce O'neale(25). Whether or not the Jazz are able to attract big free agents in the future, the Jazz have a very solid core to build around. The Jazz need more experience and a couple of moves away from being real contendors for a title.
