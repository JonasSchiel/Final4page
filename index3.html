         <h1>Orgins of the Jazz</h1>
         <p>
          Jazz and Utah are not something that one would typically associate with eachother, so why is this Utah's name? The Jazz were previously known as the New Orleans Jazz, in 1979 the team was moved to Utah. To show respect to the team, the team owner, Larry Miller, decided to keep the name. The Jazz have been in Utah for 50 years now, they have since then made 28 playoff appearences, along with 16 conference semifinal appearances, 6 conference final appearances, and 2 back to back finals appearances in 1996-97 and 1997-98.
         </p>
         
         <h2>Finals appearances</h2>
         
         <p>In the two years that the Jazz made the finals, they were lead by the hall of famer, John Stockton, and the hall of famer and 2 time MVP, Karl Malone. They faced the Bulls in back to back years. They Bulls were led by arguably the best player of all time, Michael Jordan, and hall of famer Scottie Pippen. They also had the help of Dennis Rodman and Stev Kerr. The Jazz were beat 2-4 in each series.
